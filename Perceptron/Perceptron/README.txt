1.Run the program
  (1)Copy the data2 folder into debug folder which includes the file Perceptron.exe, 
     then double click the Perceptron.exe to run the program.
  
  (2)Copy the whole project folder to a place you want,then using the software visual studio 2012 or higher version
     to open the project, the project file is Perceptron.sln. then you can edit or run the program.

2.Function of the project
  The project uses the Perceptron algorithm and with the training examples establishing a simple linear text classifier classifying the text between positive and negative.

3.Project architecture
  There are five files s1-s5 in the folder data2, which are the original file used to train the classifier and testing.
